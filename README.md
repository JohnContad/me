# Hi! I'm John Contad, but I go by JC.

Maybe we're just meeting. Or maybe we're working together. Or maybe I'm serving as your manager. Either way, here's a quick and dirty list of what I value, what I prioritize, and how I generally work. I'm flexible tho, so it's more of a general expectation list.

## Tell us about yourself?

I've worked as a fencemaker, a cook, a pastor, a copywriter, a writer, a horror stories podcaster, an illustrator, a bad club DJ, a bad cover band guitarist. I can talk smack about a lot of things.

The last 10 years have been in Operations - which means I've seen a lot (*A LOT*) of things go wrong. That means I care about uptime, reliability, security, and *damn-robust-engineering*. That also means that I care really, really deeply about engineering that's sustainable to the people working on it: so I try to avoid overtimes, try to minimize pressure. And that at the end of the day, we have to try and be kind to each other.

## So. Expectations.

### What do I expect from you?

 - *To care.* Care about the team, care about our goals, but also care for yourself. We're all here for each other.

 - *To tell.* You can call me out on my crap, anytime - and I super-appreciate that. You can talk to me freely about what I can improve - but also what's going well so far.

 - *To ask.* You can come to me for advice, or help - and I'll do my utmost to have your back. But most importantly, ask me *why*.


### What can you expect from me?

 - *To have candor.* I'll be honest and upfront with what I think anytime - and I do my best to do that with care.

 - *To have opinions.* I sometimes have strong opinions, but try to have them loosely held.

 - *To care.* I have a lot of love for making sure that people grow and succeed. Sometimes it's through supporting you, but sometimes I'll apply some pressure (but not without asking first).

 - *To make sure you can focus on your job.* To shield you from distractions whenever possible, to make sure that you're spending most of your time doing what you love doing.

 - *To make decisions.* I'm comfortable making decisions - even when things are dicey or unsure. But I'll also make sure that you build your confidence in making them.


### Quirks

 - *Questions*. I ask a messload of questions. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a [resting weird face](https://medium.com/@jpcontad/i-took-pictures-of-myself-doing-1-on-1s-abed6b2afbf7) - I try to be mindful of it, but when I do my expressions look blank. *I'm working on it.*

 - *I'm a MASSIVE introvert*. No, seriously. If you catch me A.) In a corner, with headphones on, B.) Pacing around the office aimlessly, C.) Lying on the floor, or D.) Just in a weird posture or position, I'm just recharging my social and mental batteries. *I'm working on it.*
