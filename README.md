# Hi! I'm John Contad, but I go by JC.

Maybe we're just meeting. Or maybe we're working together. Or maybe I'm serving as your manager. Either way, here's a quick and dirty list of what I value, what I prioritize, and how I generally work. I'm flexible tho, so it's more of a general expectation list.

## So. Tell us about yourself?

I've worked as a fencemaker, a cook, a pastor, a copywriter, a writer, a horror stories podcaster, an illustrator, a bad club DJ, a cover band guitarist, a support tech. I like to imagine that that gives me a wealth of life experience, but what that really means is I can talk smack about a lot of things.

The last 10 years have been in Operations - which means I've seen a lot (*A LOT*) of things go wrong. That means I care about uptime, reliability, security, and *damn-robust-engineering*. That also means that I care really, really deeply about engineering that's sustainable to the people working on it: so I try to avoid overtimes, try to minimize pressure. And that at the end of the day, we have to try and be kind to each other.

## So. Expectations.

What do I expect from you?

 - To be open and honest in our interactions
 - To call me out on my bullshit
